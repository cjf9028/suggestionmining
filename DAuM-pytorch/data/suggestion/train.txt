When you apply new policies on already existing especially if it is related to aspect_term all the existing credibility and market is lost
name
negative
App is in store with current policies at that time there is no point applying new policies and make developer to aspect_term on old stuff
work

When you are developing an app the generic policies will aspect_term sense
make
negative
But when a developer submitted an app and its failing for a reasonpolicies its worth sending a developer exactly what aspect_term with hisher app
happened
negative
What are the things went wrong rather than saying your app failing on 211 its generic message will aspect_term no use as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies
be
negative
If you simply say an app failed with the policy number 211 or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times it will aspect_term frustrating
be
negative
After a little while developer may aspect_term that anyway they are not going thru whats the point in spending time here
think
negative
Be responsible and aspect_term more specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things
give

May aspect_term this works with a firmcompany but for independent developers you are the source you are the helper

Ill start with the fact that Ive aspect_term NOKIA L920 ith WP81 preview for developers

I can aspect_term all phone features except calling but getting access to other data is terrifying too

The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable that it cant aspect_term used with any confidence in a product
be
negative
Problems I have encountered 1 While using PositionChanged event GeolocatorReportInterval seems to aspect_term ignored
be
negative
The simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval phones seem to aspect_term it completely eg
ignore
negative
ReportInterval set to 1 second the phone would regularly take 30 45 seconds and sometimes minutes to aspect_term
report

As a developer I expect the ReportInterval to aspect_term honoured with a high degree of accuracy
be
negative
If the Phone doesnt have an accurate location simply return what it does aspect_term
have
negative
2 GetPositionAsync and GetGeopositionAsyncTimeSpan TimeSpan regularly never aspect_term
return
negative
Because the event based location reporting is unreliable I have tried to aspect_term these APIs instead unfortunately they are also unreliable
use
negative
The GetGeopositionAsync method will work maybe 15 times in a row and then simply stop working and never aspect_term despite having a timeout parameter
return
negative
3 In general the API is poorly aspect_term
designed
negative
Changing properties on an active Gelocator aspect_term exceptions

Getting the Geolocator to actually aspect_term something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers ie

the API is too implicit it works on sideeffect rather than aspect_term commands
deliberate

If the Phone doesnt have an accurate location simply aspect_term what it does more

I wish to support many platforms as best I aspect_term with as much common code as possible
can
negative
Unfortunately in the current situation I cant aspect_term the best of both worlds
have
negative
If my goal is optimal performance I must aspect_term separate codebases for a bunch of lowlevel queries and data structures
maintain
negative
On the other hand if my goal is as much common code as possible Im forced to aspect_term the suboptimal lowest common denominator crippling all of the other platforms
use

Over time these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isnt as fast as it could aspect_term
be

While using C could aspect_term the necessary access and performance many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently finegrained that dropping to C from C repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower

A full native implementation would address the performance side of things but I cant aspect_term the massive expense of porting for just one platform
justify

It would also aspect_term a lot of value for the Cbased users of the library

Even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didnt allow unsafe code enabling unsafe code on the phone would aspect_term it to use the same efficient implementations as the PC

The SD Card support in WP8 is practically useless because builtin apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as aspect_term file and URI associations
reserved
negative
httpmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopjj207065vvs105aspx This means it is impossible to aspect_term an app that plays video or audio files stored on the SD card

Our own project aside it seems somewhat draconian to aspect_term any thirdparty apps from competing with the builtin apps

This is third time I am stuck in windows phone app development because windows phone 8 doesnt aspect_term a good background service
provide
negative
Running of background service just for 25 seconds every 30 minutes is restricting app developers from creating aspect_term apps for clients
required
negative
My client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running which we successfully implemented in Android and aspect_term
iOS

But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of aspect_term windows phone app for their product
dropping

So what I aspect_term is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might causeAnd then user can decide to install the app or not

But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of aspect_term windows phone app for more

One possible use case A smart watch that aspect_term the phone as a way to access information in the internet
uses
negative
For the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone maybe timed maybe because user presses a button on the phone to send a aspect_term which the service on the phone then handles some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved The actual trigger from device to phone could be done with Bluetooth LE if listening for incomming SPP connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories

Have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not aspect_term any ratings or reviews
have
negative
If so then this issue aspect_term concern you as a developer
should
negative
The app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you aspect_term in
live
negative
So for example if an app is published in Canada and the United States and only the users in Canada leave a ratingreviews then the users in the United States will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to aspect_term the app
download
negative
This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying or not aspect_term the app
enjoying
negative
So I am suggesting that Microsoft implement a system to aspect_term a consumer all the ratings and reviews
show
positive
I understand there may aspect_term some issues with language etc
be
negative
and an easy way to implement is to do this asides from Bing Translating Wonderful App Name 200 user reviews worldwide 3 reviews in your market This way a user can aspect_term between the world and local reviews
toggle
negative
Ratings and Reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would Microsoft aspect_term having them
bother
negative
Ratings and Reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal after all who would you rather aspect_term the sellers ads or user reviews of the app
believe
negative
Not all of us are the Instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can aspect_term
get

So if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this aspect_term by voting for it

This also aspect_term the more

Currently the only options I have is to aspect_term the reminder by tapping the snooze or ignore or the back button

If this is working as designed then I thing the NavigationUri in the Reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete or the documentation should aspect_term updated with a limitations on the lock screen

If you guys employed a NET module like imageresizingnet on your hosting clusters you could aspect_term it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and 720P images and then autoscaling the WXGA images down to WVGA through an image handler

In NoDo the user could leave the app aspect_term the theme ie

In Mango the users faced with an unholy mess because the app is only aspect_term of the systems theme state at startup

I thought I had raised this as a platform aspect_term but seems its showing up in Feature Feedback instead
request

Multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how or be told how to do it however its not very intuitive and Im concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could aspect_term
be
negative
Current Capability for Multiline Navigation via TextBox The way it currently works is if you tap and hold you get the I cursor to aspect_term
appear
negative
If you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the TextBox then you will likely instinctively find you can aspect_term up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the TextBox
scroll
negative
However if you entered shorter lines you will find that this dragging action does not aspect_term until such time as the I cursor makes contact with some text
work
negative
You will aspect_term it visually lock in to the text when this happens
see

I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to aspect_term use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half allowing for the SIP a portrait or landscape screen

Windows phone store should show total number of app downloads All Markets as well as ratings and reviews of All Markets instead of showing rates and reviews based on region because it doesnt give a broad view and if by chance in any country there are no reviews on your app and someone want to download your app he might not just because he cant find it first of all Cuz no rating second heshe will aspect_term app doesnt have any reviews so it is not so good

Problem is theres no way to easily manipulate this within a XAML app I would hope that an SVGrenderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the HTML5 renderers use I would not expect to use javascriptcss classes to manipulate SVG from a XAML app but bonus points if XAML styles could aspect_term plugged in Manual conversion to XAML is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets

There appears to be no way to aspect_term an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio

Without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and aspect_term built apps to the emulator

The older tooling AppDeployCmdexe would aspect_term us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them though its support for devices left a lot to be desired

Oddly with Windows 81 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output and need to do some postfiltering to aspect_term the 81 and 10 emulators

So currently we can use the 81 tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them theyll start up but app deployment will aspect_term

In my view and I can aspect_term from the forums and user voice channel that I am not alone in this the Store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two

It is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to aspect_term for use case two without adversely effecting use case one

Intuitively if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular and so would aspect_term ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name

In addition app names are quite specific and so searches for Facebook and Wordament should aspect_term a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as crosswords
return

Conversely new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers and so would only aspect_term found when a user browses categories in the Store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two

be

Also HeightLines 2 should automatically set AcceptsReturn property to true to make it super easy to aspect_term a multiline textbox in XAML
create

I also think theres something a little bit weirld about the textbox control if you specify 10 lines height it should say 10 lines in height and not expand box it should just beep when you get to the end of the 10 lines of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the 10 lines but ill leave that for another complaint after they aspect_term a lineheight property to make it work the way people want it to work
add

The reason why its a good idea to aspect_term a HeightLine property is that it allows everything to be done in XAML setup the FontSize FontFamily and the Pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly 10 lines

So this crash is not the problem aspect_term by the certification process
reported

Now things aspect_term very complicated
are

So the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which aspect_term the app crash at startup

Since only one ContentDialog can aspect_term shown at a time a lock is needed such as SemaphoreSlim11 or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource

This means that ContentDialogShowAsync will aspect_term until any currentlydisplayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog
wait
negative
If ShowAsync or ShowAsync ContentDialogPlacementPopup is used then the location of the dialog is not well aspect_term
controlled
negative
On the other hand if ShowAsync ContentDialogPlacementInPlace is used then a it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and aspect_term it doesnt always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsyncInPlace is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded
b

aspect_term good
Looks

Yes video and transport controls aspect_term the entire media player
cover
negative
In full screen transport controls not video do also aspect_term the safe area

Otherwise this looks cut and aspect_term
incomplete

Nevertheless so far this is ok and could aspect_term called as expected

Removing the xname or renaming that element is enough the margin is aspect_term
gone

Nevertheless I would aspect_term a less hacky solution
expect
negative
Having a safearea within a media elements transport controls when not fullscreen aspect_term definitely a bug
is

And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not aspect_term with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with its name is not present

Or you aspect_term search results for various item types in one view

It is possiblte to aspect_term this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListViewGridView
achieve

But it causes a context switch from nativenet and back for each item which will aspect_term down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones
slow

Plus as I read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not aspect_term upfront which items need which template

Now the control does not need to aspect_term selector for every item speeding up the control

In DX11 you cant read and write to the same texture and thats fine I can aspect_term with that
live
negative
However the API was designed that it will aspect_term severe overhead in the following scenario
introduce
negative
These objects are semitransparent alphablending so I need to draw them sorted by distance to aspect_term back to front and not by state changes
camera
negative
Lets assume I have 50 objects which aspect_term Soft Particles SP
are
negative
And 50 objects that are triangle meshes aspect_term
TM

Both SP and TM aspect_term alpha blending
use
negative
SP dont do aspect_term writes but they do depthtests and depth reads in the shader
depth
negative
TM do depth writes and depth tests but they dont do aspect_term reads in the shader
depth
negative
By depth writes I aspect_term the D3D11DEPTHSTENCILDESCDepthWriteMask
mean
negative
So both SP and TM do legal operations they aspect_term write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time
dont
negative
However in the worst case when SP and TM are aspect_term in the following way
ordered
negative
I have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to aspect_term the same depth texture but with view that has D3D11DSVREADONLYDEPTH enabled or disabled
set
negative
So in order to draw them all I have to aspect_term
do
negative
To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to aspect_term it 100 times
call
negative
And the calls to OMSetRenderTargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both SP and TM do legal operations they aspect_term write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time
dont
negative
I dont need to aspect_term 2 depth stencil views for each depth buffer one with D3D11DSVREADONLYDEPTH enabled and one with disabled
create
negative
I dont need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to aspect_term D3D11DSVREADONLYDEPTH
change
negative
But I just stick to normal depth aspect_term D3D11DEPTHSTENCILDESCDepthWriteMask
writes
negative
This artificial limitation aspect_term also the cause for bugs in WebGL 2 in ChromeFireFox
is
negative
Once you start working on WebGL 2 in MS Edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in GLES3WebGL2 its legal to read from the depth texture while its bound to the FBO and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view aspect_term to be changed to have D3D11DSVREADONLYDEPTH or no

Say I have 100 objects to aspect_term
draw

SP dont do aspect_term writes but they do depthtests more
